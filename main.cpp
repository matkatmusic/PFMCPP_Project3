 Project 3 - Part 1 / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
 User-Defined Types

 Create a branch named Part1
 
 1) write 10 user-defined types, each with a random number of member variables
    try to make the member variables have names that are related to the user-defined type.
 
 2) give the member variables relevant data types
 
 3) add a couple member functions.  
    make the function parameter list for those member functions use some of your User-Defined Types
 
 4) make 2 of the 10 user-defined types be nested class
 
 5) One of your UDTs should only use UDTs for its member variable types.   
     No primitives allowed!
 
 6) After you finish defining each type, click the [run] button.  Clear up any errors or warnings as best you can.
 
 Commit your changes by clicking on the Source Control panel on the left, entering a message, and click [Commit and push].
 
 Send me the the link to your repl.it in a DM on Slack

 Wait for my code review.
